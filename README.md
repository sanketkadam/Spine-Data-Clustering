Clustering Medical Data

Lower back pain can be caused by a variety of problems with any parts of the complex, interconnected network of spinal muscles, nerves, bones, discs or tendons in the lumbar spine. This data set is about to identify a person is abnormal or normal using collected physical spine details.
	
The variables in the dataset are,

pelvic_incidence  
pelvic_tilt 
lumbar_lordosis_angle 
sacral_slope 
pelvic_radius 
degree_spondylolisthesis 
pelvic_slope
Direct_tilt
thoracic_slope
cervical_tilt
sacrum_angle
scoliosis_slope

Using the dataset the client would like to be one step ahead and check whether his new patients who come to visit him have a lower back problem or the symptoms could be indications of some other problem.
